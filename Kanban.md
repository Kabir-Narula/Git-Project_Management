# Kanban Cheat Sheet

## What is Kanban?
Kanban is a workflow management method that helps teams visualize their work, limit work in progress (WIP), and maximize efficiency. Originally developed as part of Toyota's production system, it has since been adapted for knowledge work, including software development, IT, and many other fields.

## Core Principles of Kanban:

### 1. **Visualize Workflow**
- The key element of Kanban is visualizing work. This is typically done on a **Kanban board**, where tasks are represented as cards that move through columns corresponding to different stages of completion (e.g., "To Do", "In Progress", "Done").
- **Purpose**: Helps teams see the flow of work and identify any bottlenecks or inefficiencies.

### 2. **Limit Work in Progress (WIP)**
- Each stage of the process has a set limit on the number of tasks that can be worked on at the same time.
- **Purpose**: To avoid overloading team members and encourage them to finish tasks before starting new ones.

### 3. **Manage Flow**
- Focus on the smooth flow of tasks through the stages of completion. Measuring how long it takes for tasks to go from start to finish (cycle time) helps teams improve efficiency.
- **Purpose**: Ensure continuous progress and identify blockers in the workflow.

### 4. **Make Process Policies Explicit**
- Clear, agreed-upon rules for how work moves between stages. Everyone on the team should understand these policies, such as when a task is considered "Done."
- **Purpose**: Create clarity and consistency in how work is managed.

### 5. **Implement Feedback Loops**
- Regular reviews, such as daily standups or retrospectives, are used to provide feedback and make improvements to the process.
- **Purpose**: Continuously refine and improve the workflow.

### 6. **Improve Collaboratively, Evolve Experimentally**
- Kanban encourages small, incremental improvements to the process over time. Teams use experimentation and feedback to continuously evolve.
- **Purpose**: Foster a culture of continuous improvement.

## Kanban Board

A **Kanban Board** is a visual tool that shows the workflow and stages of a process. It is the core of Kanban and typically consists of the following elements:

### Key Components:
1. **Columns (Stages of the Workflow)**: These represent different phases of work (e.g., "Backlog", "In Progress", "Testing", "Done"). Columns vary based on the workflow being managed.
2. **Cards (Tasks/Items)**: These represent individual tasks that move through the workflow.
3. **WIP Limits**: Work-in-progress limits are set for each column to ensure that team members focus on completing tasks before starting new ones.

## Key Metrics in Kanban:

### 1. **Cycle Time**
- The amount of time it takes for a task to move from the start to the finish of the workflow.
- **Why it matters**: Shorter cycle times mean tasks are being completed faster, which leads to better efficiency.

### 2. **Lead Time**
- The total time from when a task is requested to when it is completed. This includes both waiting time and work time.
- **Why it matters**: Lead time helps teams understand the overall time to deliver a request to the customer.

### 3. **Throughput**
- The number of tasks completed in a given time period.
- **Why it matters**: It provides insight into how productive a team is and helps in forecasting future work completion rates.

## Kanban vs. Scrum:
While both Kanban and Scrum are Agile methodologies, they differ in several key ways:

| **Aspect**               | **Kanban**                            | **Scrum**                             |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Focus**                 | Continuous flow of work               | Time-boxed Sprints                    |
| **Planning**              | On-demand as work arrives             | Sprint Planning for each iteration    |
| **Roles**                 | No defined roles (team members manage themselves) | Defined roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team) |
| **WIP Limits**            | Central to Kanban                     | Not explicitly defined in Scrum       |
| **Board**                 | Visualizes work in progress           | Used to track sprint tasks            |
| **Changes**               | Continuous, can happen anytime        | Changes are limited during the Sprint |

## How to Implement Kanban:

### Step 1: Visualize Your Workflow
- Set up a board that represents each stage of your process. Common stages might be **To Do**, **In Progress**, and **Done**.

### Step 2: Set WIP Limits
- Determine the maximum number of tasks that can be worked on at any given time in each stage. This will prevent team members from being overloaded and ensure they focus on completing tasks.

### Step 3: Track and Measure Flow
- Use metrics like cycle time and throughput to measure the flow of tasks. Identify where bottlenecks are happening and address them.

### Step 4: Review and Improve Regularly
- Hold regular stand-ups, retrospectives, or reviews to discuss how the team is performing and what improvements can be made.

## Example of Kanban in Action:

Imagine a **software development team** using Kanban. Here’s how it might look:

1. **Columns**: They have columns for **Backlog**, **Development**, **Testing**, and **Done** on their Kanban board.
2. **WIP Limits**: They set a WIP limit of 3 tasks in the **Development** stage and 2 in **Testing**. This ensures that developers don’t start more than 3 tasks at once and testers don’t get overwhelmed.
3. **Cycle Time**: They measure how long each feature takes from entering **Development** to moving to **Done**. Their goal is to reduce this over time by improving their process.

Over time, they review their **cycle time** and **throughput** to see if they are delivering work faster. They adjust their WIP limits and experiment with new practices to improve their efficiency.

## Benefits of Kanban:
- **Increased Visibility**: The Kanban board makes the workflow and task status visible to everyone, enhancing communication.
- **Improved Efficiency**: Limiting WIP ensures team members focus on finishing work, reducing context switching and bottlenecks.
- **Flexibility**: Teams can make changes to priorities or introduce new tasks at any time without disrupting the overall process.
- **Continuous Delivery**: With Kanban, teams can deliver work continuously, without waiting for a Sprint to end, which is great for teams handling maintenance or support.

## Kanban in Different Industries:

### 1. **Software Development**
   - Teams use Kanban to manage bug fixes, feature requests, and continuous delivery. It allows for flexibility when handling ongoing support tasks alongside feature development.

### 2. **IT Operations**
   - Kanban is perfect for managing service desk tasks or IT operations work, where new tasks arrive frequently, and teams must prioritize and complete tasks dynamically.

### 3. **Manufacturing**
   - Originally from Toyota’s production line, Kanban is used to manage stock levels, ensuring parts are replenished just in time to avoid overproduction or shortages.

### 4. **Marketing Teams**
   - Marketing teams use Kanban boards to track campaigns, content creation, and deliverables, enabling them to balance long-term projects with day-to-day tasks.

## Conclusion:
Kanban is a flexible and visual way to manage work. It can be implemented in any industry where teams need to manage tasks dynamically and continuously deliver value. With a focus on visualizing work, limiting WIP, and improving flow, Kanban helps teams become more efficient and deliver better results over time.
