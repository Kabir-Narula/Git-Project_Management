# Scrum Detailed Cheat Shee
---

## Scrum Definition
Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams, and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems. Scrum emphasizes empiricism, self-organization, and continuous improvement.

---

## Scrum Theory
Scrum is based on **empiricism** (knowledge comes from experience) and **lean thinking** (reducing waste). Scrum requires an iterative and incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk.

### Transparency
The process, work, and progress must be visible to those performing the work and those receiving the work. Transparency ensures that decision-making is based on the true state of the work.

### Inspection
Scrum artifacts and the progress toward agreed goals must be frequently inspected to detect issues. Scrum's formal events (like Daily Scrum) are key to enabling regular inspection.

### Adaptation
If any deviations occur, processes or product aspects must be adjusted. Teams adapt based on what is learned during inspection events, allowing them to stay aligned with project goals.

## Scrum Roles
There are three key roles in Scrum: **Development Team**, **Product Owner**, and **Scrum Master**. These roles describe responsibilities, but they do not imply new job titles. Any job title can perform a Scrum role.

### Development Team
The development team consists of the individuals who execute the work of creating the product increment. Contrary to popular belief, the "developer" role is not limited to programmers; it includes anyone with the skills to deliver work (e.g., designers, UX specialists, writers). The development team is self-organizing and empowered to make decisions to complete the sprint’s goals.

#### Responsibilities:
- Delivering work within the sprint.
- Conducting Daily Scrum meetings to inspect progress.
- Ensuring quality by adhering to the **Definition of Done**.
- Self-organizing to make decisions and solve problems autonomously.

### Product Owner
The product owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product and is the voice of the business and customer. They manage the **Product Backlog** and prioritize the work to ensure that the Scrum team is delivering the highest value features.

#### Responsibilities:
- Managing and prioritizing the Product Backlog.
- Defining and communicating the **Product Goal**.
- Ensuring that the team understands the backlog and priorities.
- Collaborating with stakeholders and ensuring their input is reflected in the backlog.

### Scrum Master
The Scrum Master is the facilitator of the Scrum process, responsible for ensuring that Scrum is understood and enacted effectively. They help the team adhere to Scrum principles and facilitate collaboration.

#### Responsibilities:
- Coaching the team on Scrum practices and values.
- Facilitating Scrum events and ensuring they are effective.
- Removing impediments that block the team's progress.
- Protecting the team from external disruptions.

## Scrum Values
Scrum relies on five core values:
1. **Commitment** – Everyone commits to achieving team goals.
2. **Focus** – All efforts are focused on the work of the sprint.
3. **Openness** – Team members are open about their work and challenges.
4. **Respect** – Team members respect each other's skills and abilities.
5. **Courage** – Team members have the courage to tackle tough challenges and make bold decisions.

## Scrum Events
Scrum defines five key events, all designed to provide formal opportunities for inspection and adaptation of Scrum artifacts.

### Sprint
A **Sprint** is a time-boxed event (usually 2–4 weeks) where the team works on tasks that deliver value toward the **Sprint Goal**. During the sprint:
- No changes are made that endanger the Sprint Goal.
- The Product Backlog is refined if needed.
- Quality standards are maintained, and scope can be adjusted with the Product Owner.

### Sprint Planning
Sprint Planning sets the stage for the sprint by deciding what work will be done. The Scrum team collaborates to define:
1. **Why** this Sprint is valuable (Sprint Goal).
2. **What** can be done in this Sprint (selected backlog items).
3. **How** the work will be accomplished (task breakdown).

### Daily Scrum
A 15-minute daily meeting where the development team inspects progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapts their plan. The team discusses what was done yesterday, what will be done today, and any blockers.

### Sprint Review
At the end of the sprint, the team holds a Sprint Review to demonstrate the work completed. The Product Owner and stakeholders discuss the work delivered and whether any adaptations to the Product Backlog are necessary.

### Sprint Retrospective
After the Sprint Review, the team holds a Retrospective to reflect on the sprint's successes, failures, and areas for improvement. The goal is to continuously improve processes for future sprints.

## Scrum Artifacts

### Product Backlog
The **Product Backlog** is an ordered list of all work items required to improve the product. The **Product Goal** guides backlog refinement, and backlog items should be clear, prioritized, and ready for upcoming sprints.

### Sprint Backlog
The **Sprint Backlog** consists of:
- The **Sprint Goal** (why this Sprint is valuable).
- The selected backlog items for the Sprint (what will be delivered).
- The task breakdown (how the work will be done).

### Increment
An **Increment** is the usable outcome of work completed during a sprint. It represents progress toward the **Product Goal** and must meet the **Definition of Done**.

---

## Additional Scrum Concepts

### Backlog Refinement
Backlog refinement is an ongoing activity where the Product Owner and development team discuss the Product Backlog, breaking items down and providing more detail. This ensures that items are clear, ordered, and ready for sprint planning.

### Scrum of Scrums
The **Scrum of Scrums** is an approach used for coordinating multiple Scrum teams working on the same product. Each team sends a representative to a larger meeting where cross-team dependencies and progress are discussed, ensuring alignment and collaboration across teams.
