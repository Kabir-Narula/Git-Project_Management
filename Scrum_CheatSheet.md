# Scrum Guide Cheat Sheet


---

## Scrum Definition
Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams, and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems. In summary, Scrum requires:
1. A **Product Owner** to organize work into a **Product Backlog**.
2. The **Scrum Team** to convert the selected work into a usable **Increment** of value during a **Sprint**.
3. Regular inspection and adaptation of results with stakeholders.
4. Repetition of this process to improve.

## Scrum Theory
Scrum is founded on **empiricism** and **lean thinking**. Knowledge comes from experience, and decisions are made based on observations.

### Transparency
The process and work must be visible to those performing and receiving the work. Artifacts that lack transparency can lead to poor decisions.

### Inspection
Frequent inspection of Scrum artifacts and progress helps detect problems early. Scrum has formal events (e.g., Daily Scrum) to enable regular inspection.

### Adaptation
If the product or process deviates from acceptable standards, immediate adjustment is necessary to minimize further issues. Scrum Teams must be empowered to adapt based on what they learn through inspection.

## Scrum Values
Successful Scrum depends on people living five core values:
1. **Commitment**
2. **Focus**
3. **Openness**
4. **Respect**
5. **Courage**

These values guide the teamâ€™s work and behavior, ensuring transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

## Scrum Team
The Scrum Team consists of:
- **Developers**
- **Product Owner**
- **Scrum Master**

Scrum Teams are **cross-functional** (all skills needed to complete work) and **self-managing** (decide who does what, when, and how).

### Developers
Responsible for:
- Creating a plan (Sprint Backlog).
- Ensuring quality by adhering to the **Definition of Done**.
- Adjusting the plan as needed.
- Holding each other accountable.

### Product Owner
Responsible for:
- Maximizing product value.
- Managing the **Product Backlog** (creating, ordering, and ensuring visibility of items).
- Communicating the **Product Goal**.

### Scrum Master
Responsible for:
- Ensuring Scrum is understood and followed.
- Enabling the Scrum Team to improve its practices.
- Coaching and removing impediments.

## Scrum Events

### The Sprint
- A **Sprint** is a fixed-length event (max 1 month) where work is converted into value.
- During the Sprint, no changes should jeopardize the **Sprint Goal**, and quality should not decrease.
- Sprints allow regular **inspection** and **adaptation**.

### Sprint Planning
The Scrum Team plans the Sprint, addressing:
1. Why is this Sprint valuable?
2. What can be done in this Sprint?
3. How will the work be accomplished?

### Daily Scrum
A 15-minute event where Developers inspect progress toward the **Sprint Goal** and adapt their plan for the next day.

### Sprint Review
A working session to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and adapt future goals. The Product Backlog may also be adjusted.

### Sprint Retrospective
The team inspects how the Sprint went and identifies improvements for the next Sprint.

## Scrum Artifacts

### Product Backlog
An emergent, ordered list of work required to improve the product. The **Product Goal** is a commitment that guides the Product Backlog.

### Sprint Backlog
Contains the **Sprint Goal**, selected Product Backlog items, and a plan to deliver the Increment. The Sprint Goal provides flexibility in how the team works.

### Increment
An Increment is a usable result of work done, contributing toward the **Product Goal**. Each Increment must meet the **Definition of Done**.
